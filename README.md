# Visual Studio + Power Platform Custom Connector + PowerFx + Azure API Management

This shows a sample application architecture that shows:

- A back-end API app (ASP.NET Core Web API) running inventory management that Visual Studio directly exports a Power Platform custom connector is directly exported from Visual Studio,
- A front-end app (Blazor WebAssembly) that uses the PowerFx syntax through the Power Platform custon connector, and
- A back-end API app (ASP.NET Core Web API) running GitHub issue summary that Visual Studio directly publishes to Azure App Service and integrates it with Azure API Management.
